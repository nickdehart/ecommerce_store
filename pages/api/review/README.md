##### GET
- Retrieves a single review object by product name.
- Runs an aggregation to count review ratings
   - This is used to construct the 'stars' object

##### POST
- Creates a new review object for a product that currently does not have one.
- Initializes all fields of the object and inserts it into Mongo.
- Initializes 'stars' object to a starter value.

##### PUT
- Pushes a new review into a single review object's 'reviews' array.
- Increments 'count' property by one.
- Recalculates new 'avg' of reviews for update.
- Does NOT update 'stars' object.

##### TODO
- Need to decide an action for 'stars' object.
   - Either move aggregation and recalculation to PUT method insetead of GET
   - OR
   - Remove 'stars' object from review object and allow GET to calculate it.
- Images only used if already existing in Mongo
   - No logic exists to update 'images'
   - No front end capability to prompt upload of images
- Currently unused review fields:
   - country
   - useful
   - useless
